# DONATE ME

A project where people can ask for anything they need - money for food, cloth, electronic, education, anything.
Anyone could 'donate' to that person if he thinks that this person really needs that. 

A creator of request sets hard limit and expiry date:
 - if the limit has been reached, he can get the money. 
 - if the offer has beed expired, any 'donator' can get his money back.
